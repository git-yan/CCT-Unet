# CCT-Unet
This repo is the official implementation of "A U-shaped Network based on Convolution Coupled Transformer for Segmentation of Peripheral and Transition Zones in Prostate MRI".

## overview
In this work, a U-shaped network based on the convolution coupled Transformer is proposed for segmentation of peripheral and transition zones in prostate MRI, named the convolution coupled Transformer U-Net (CCT-Unet). The convolutional embedding block is first designed for encoding high-resolution input to retain the edge detail of the image. Then the convolution coupled Transformer block is proposed to enhance the ability of local feature extraction and capture long-term correlation that encompass anatomical information. The feature conversion module is also proposed to alleviate the semantic gap in the process of jumping connection.
